## **Overview**
**Growlify** is an AI + IoT-powered urban farming system designed for city environments where space, air quality, and time are limited.  
It enables **smart plant care through deep learning–based disease detection, weather-aware irrigation, automated reminders, and organic farming guidance**.

Growlify works as a **personal plant guardian**, especially for balconies and small urban homes.

---

## **Problem Statement**
Rapid urbanization in India has led to:
- Severe **air pollution** in cities like **Delhi, Uttar Pradesh regions, Bengaluru, and Chennai**
- Reduced green cover and increasing **carbon footprint**
- Limited access to clean, self-grown food
- Lack of gardening knowledge among urban residents

Despite awareness, many people avoid home gardening due to:
- Unpredictable weather
- Plant diseases
- Irregular watering
- Busy lifestyles

This directly impacts **environmental sustainability, mental well-being, and urban air quality**.

---

## **Why Open Innovation (Open Bharat Track)**
Growlify aligns with **Open Innovation – Open Bharat** because:

- 🌍 India is facing **critical environmental challenges** due to pollution and urban congestion  
- 🌱 Promotes **decentralized green growth** at household level  
- 🏙️ Encourages citizens to convert balconies into **micro green zones**  
- ♻️ Supports **sustainable living, water optimization, and organic practices**  
- 🇮🇳 Empowers India’s vision of **self-reliant, eco-conscious urban communities**

Growlify is not just a product — it is a **citizen-driven environmental movement**.

---

## **Proposed Solution**
Growlify provides an end-to-end solution with:

- 🌱 **Smart Onboarding & Localization**  
  PIN-code-based weather detection for plant-specific care

- 🌱 **AI-Driven Plant Disease Diagnosis**  
  Upload leaf images to detect diseases and get treatment suggestions

- 🌱 **Deep Learning CNN Model (Python)**  
  Trained on **50,000+ plant leaf images**  
  Achieved **98.5% accuracy** using CNN architecture

- 🌱 **Automated Smart Reminders**  
  Email alerts for watering and treatment, dynamically adjusted to rainfall

- 🌱 **Organic Care Tips & Eco Store**  
  Eggshell compost, banana peel water, neem oil suggestions

- 🌱 **IoT Smart Irrigation with Fail-Safe Logic**  
  If **electricity or Wi-Fi is OFF**, the system automatically releases a **minimum safe amount of water every 2 days** to prevent plant death
